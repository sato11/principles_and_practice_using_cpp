# Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++
Exercises from Bjarne Stroustrup's *[Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (Second Edition)](http://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html)*.

## Setup for MacOS
Get GCC 8 via homebrew to make full use of the latest implementation of c++.

```
brew update
brew install gcc
ln -s /usr/local/bin/g++-9 /usr/local/bin/g++
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gcc-9 /usr/local/bin/gcc
```

With this done, run a super simple make task to get Mr. Stroustrup's custom header file from online by running:

```
make download
```
